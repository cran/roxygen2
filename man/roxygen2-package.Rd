\title{roxygen2: In-Line Documentation for R}
\description{
Generate your Rd documentation, 'NAMESPACE' file, and collation
field using specially formatted comments. Writing documentation in-line
with code makes it easier to keep your documentation up-to-date as your
requirements change. 'Roxygen2' is inspired by the 'Doxygen' system for C++.
}
\details{
See \code{vignette("roxygen2", package = "roxygen2")} for an overview
of the package, \code{vignette("rd", package = "roxygen2")} for generating
documentation, and \code{vignette("namespace", package = "roxygen2")} for
generating the namespace specification.

If you have existing Rd files, check out the \code{Rd2roxygen} package
for a convenient way of converting Rd files to roxygen comments.

Package: foobar
Version: 2.0
License: GPL (>= 2)
Description: The second version of this nonexistent package only differs in that the maintainer decided to edit the fake author information, using some features of the Authors@R field to see if formatting will be preserved, and removing some inexistent authors that did really not contribute anything to the nonsense. Otherwise, the package described herein is still fake, entirely manufactured, utterly contrived, and wholly nonexistent. In no way does it reflect the work, endorsement, or even approval of the creators named, nor is it meant to. It contains no functions, which even if they did exist would take no arguments, and even if such hypothetical functions did exist and took arguments still wouldn't return anything.
Title: A fake package for testing purposes

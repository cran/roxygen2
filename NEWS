roxygen2 2.0
------------

MAJOR CHANGES

* now works with run-time details to give more accurate output. This requires
  that the source code that roxygen is documenting be loaded prior to
  documentation. roxygen will attempt to do so, but you need to ensure
  required packages are loaded.

  Run-time data fixes some long standing bugs where roxygen couldn't correctly
  figure out function usage. We are not aware of any cases where you still
  need to use the `@usage` tag.

* written in idiomatic R, and uses S3 instead of a homegrown class system.

* roclets build up an internal data structure instead of writing to disk
  directly. This means that you can now use the `@rdname` tag to merge
  documentation for multiple functions into one file, and that only unique
  namespace directives are written to `NAMESPACE` (which makes `@importFrom`
  much more useful).

* some features have been removed, and may or may not (based on your feedback)
  be reincluded. These include the callgraph roclet, and `R CMD roxygen`,
  which only worked on some systems.

* a templating system: use the `@template` tag to insert a `brew` template
  stored in `man-roxygen`. Template variables can be set using `@templateVar
  name value` and retrieved from within the template with `<%= name %>`

* extensive use of caching to make repeated runs as fast as possible. To clear
  caches and guarantee a complete rebuild, use `clear_caches()`.

* parsing of "introduction" (the text before the first tag) has changed. Now
  the title consists of the first paragraph (i.e. all text before the first
  empty line), the second paragraph is the description and all others are put
  in the details. Any component can be overridden with `@title`,
  `@description` and `@details` as appropriate.

MINOR CHANGES

* `@name` is always output as an alias, even if `@aliases` are used.

* `@export` correctly uses `@method` to generate `@S3method` namespace
  directive

NEW TAGS

* `@rdname filename` sets the output filename (without extension). Use for
  functions non-alphanumeric functions (e.g. `[<-`) or if you want to document
  multiple functions in one file

* `@template templatename` includes a documentation template (see above)

* `@section Section title: contents` includes a section with any title. Don't
  forget the colon! That separates the title of the section from its contents.

* `@description` and `@details` tags allow you to specify description and
  details components in a template

* `@family family name` automatically adds see-also cross-references between
  all functions in a family. A function can belong to multiple families.

* `@inheritParams name` allows you to inherit the documentation for parameters
  from another function, either within the current package (`function`) or in
  any other installed package (`package:function`). Currently only supports
  single inheritance (i.e. you can't inherit from a function that inherits
  from another function), but you can have multiple @inheritParams tags.
  
* `@format` has been implemented; it existed in the roxygen package but was 
  actually ignored
